# billiards-hunt
A helper tool for a twist on Cutthroat Billiards/Kelly Pool, to assist with drawing.

## Game Rules
Every player gets a number that corresponds to a billiard ball. Nobody else can know that number. Two players cannot be assigned the same ball. Your goal is to find and sink all of your opponents balls while protecting your own. If your ball gets sunk, you are out of the game and cannot take any more shots. The final person standing wins. Setup is similar to [Kelly Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_pool), but the actual gameplay has the opposite goal.

## How to use
Each player will take turns drawing their ball on the same device, and should do so in a way that other players cannot see what they drew.
1) Click or tap the cue ball
2) The player's assigned ball will replace it
3) Hide the assignment either by clicking/tapping on the ball again, clicking the `Hide Draw` button, or simply waiting a few seconds
4) Pass the device on to the next person for them to draw their ball

After everyone has drawn, or before starting the next round, click the `Reset All Draws` button to start over.
